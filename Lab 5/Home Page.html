    <h3>About my Experience</h3>
    <p>My experience in Baguio was nothing short of amazing. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the cool mountain air and the stunning scenery that surrounded me. The city is filled with charming cafes, vibrant markets, and friendly locals who are always eager to share their culture and traditions.</p>
    <p>One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the famous Burnham Park, where I enjoyed a leisurely boat ride on the lake and strolled through the beautifully landscaped gardens. I also had the chance to explore the bustling Baguio Public Market, where I sampled delicious local delicacies and picked up unique souvenirs to take home.</p>
    <p>Another unforgettable experience was visiting the scenic Strawberry Farm in La Trinidad, where I got to pick my own strawberries and learn about the farming process. The fresh, juicy berries were a true delight, and I couldn't resist indulging in some strawberry-themed treats at the nearby cafes.</p>
    <p>Overall, my trip to Baguio was a perfect blend of relaxation.</p>
