    <h2>About BLACKPINK</h2>
    <p>
      BLACKPINK is a four-member girl group formed by YG Entertainment in 2016. The members — Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, 
      and Lisa — are known for their powerful performances and stylish image. Their debut single "Boombayah" quickly 
      captured global attention, and since then, BLACKPINK has become a household name in music and fashion.

      With hits like "DDU-DU DDU-DU," "Kill This Love," and "Pink Venom," BLACKPINK has set records on YouTube and Spotify. 
      They were the first K-pop girl group to perform at Coachella and continue to inspire fans worldwide, known as BLINKs. 
      Beyond music, the members also influence trends in fashion and beauty, each with their own solo projects and endorsements.
