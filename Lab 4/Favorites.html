    <p>Here are some of my all-time favorite movies. I enjoy films that are full of style, action, comedy, and great storytelling.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</b> â€” Action, comedy, music, and video-game vibes all in one.</li>
        <li><b>Django Unchained</b> â€” A bold western with action, revenge, and powerful storytelling.</li>
        <li><b>Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2</b> â€” Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s martial arts revenge epic (similar style to Django).</li>
        <li><b>Deadpool</b> â€” Action + comedy with a self-aware, comic-inspired vibe (similar to Scott Pilgrim).</li>
        <li><b>Baby Driver</b> â€” Stylish action film with music at its core (great mix of beats + visuals).</li>
        <li><b>The Hateful Eight</b> â€” Another Tarantino western with sharp dialogue and tension.</li>
        <li><b>Kick-Ass</b> â€” A fun, comic-style action-comedy with an edgy twist (same vibe as Scott Pilgrim).</li>
    </ul>
